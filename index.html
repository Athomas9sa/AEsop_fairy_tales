                <strong/>A Town Mouse<strong/> once visited a <em>relative</em> who <br />lived<br /> in the country. For lunch the Country Mouse served wheat stalks, roots, and acorns, with a dash of cold water for drink. The Town Mouse ate very sparingly, nibbling a little of this and a little of that, and by her manner making it very plain   that she ate the simple food only to be polite.
